      <p>Maybe you need a new iPad to make that NFT collection on Procreate? Or perhaps you're looking for a new lens for your camera to get that soft cinematic look? A few yards of fabric to test out your new dress designs? More oil paints to perfect your impressionist technique? A new monitor to preview your 4K edits in crystal clarity? Some breathing room to pay for that Blender course you've been putting off? Fresh blocks of clay to make those weird bowls you had a dream about? </p>
      <p><strong class="text-yellow-200 underline underline-offset-4 decoration-2 decoration-wavy decoration-yellow-200">Moonlight Grants</strong> are meant for all of these things! <span class="text-gray-400">(and more)</span></p>
      <p>The Moonlight grant was created to help you clear the barriers to creativity and innovation. With the help of your grant funds, we aim to make it easier for you to get access to the tools, supplies, and education you need to reach your goals.</p>
